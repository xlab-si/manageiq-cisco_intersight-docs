=== Adding a new {intersight-provider-title} to {product-title}

This section describes how to add a new {intersight-provider} to {product-title}

*Compute -> Physical Infrastructure -> Providers* page from the main navigation
on the left. New provider can be added through "Add new physical provider" dialog box.

After providing *API key ID* and *API key* (both can be generated and found on the {intersight} User Account Settings)
the user needs to validate the credentials by pressing *Validate*. If the credential validation was successful, click
*Add*.

It takes about a minute before the inventory gets populated for the first time,
so use the browser's refresh function to obtain an updated status.
