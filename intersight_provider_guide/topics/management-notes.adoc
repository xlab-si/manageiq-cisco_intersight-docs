=== Reviewing {intersight-provider-title} EVM logs

Precondition for being able to review EVM logs, user needs to have appropriate permissions.

*Control -> Log* opens Last 1000 lines from server EVM in zone `default`. User with role `EvmGroup-super_administrator`
can also download entire Policy Log File.

Moreover, with the same user role and by navigating to *Settings -> Application Settings -> Digagnostics*, Diagnostic
server EVM allows review of Workers, Collect Logs, ManageIQ Logs, Audit Log and Development Log.

=== Backup and restore of the {postgres} database

ManageIQ uses {postgres} Database as persistency layer. In order to manage the data (e.g. backup) {postgres} commands
need to be used for this purpose.

NOTE: In this document manageIQ's ``vmdb_development'' database instance will be used.

==== Backup the {postgres} DB:

[arabic]
. Stop the appliance(s):
+
[source,bash]
----
systemctl stop evmserverd
----
+
This will stop the `evmserverd.service` from using database in background but no need to stop them, for creating backup it does not affect
anything

. Dump the database into file:
+
[source,bash]
----
pg_dump -Fc vmdb_development > development.dump
----
+
If the output is similar to this:
+
[source,bash]
----
pg_dump: [archiver (db)] connection to database "vmdb_development" failed: connection to server on socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432" failed: FATAL: role "<your_username>" does not exist
----
+
add `-U root` to every {postgres} command (in {postgres} installation for {product-title} you define `root` as the
user of {product-title} databases).

==== Import the {postgres} dump

[arabic]
. Take `development.dump` to the machine where the database needs to be restored.
. Stop the backend processes
+
[source,bash]
----
systemctl stop evmserverd
----

. Drop existing database `vmdb_development`
+
[source,bash]
----
dropdb vmdb_development
----

. Create new database named `vmdb_development`
+
[source,bash]
----
createdb vmdb_development
----

. Restore the database from dump file
+
[source,bash]
----
pg_restore -d vmdb_development "path/to/development.dump"
----

. Run `fix_auth.rb`
+
[source,bash]
----
bundle exec tools/fix_auth.rb --v2 vmdb_development
----

. Start `evm` service
+
[source,bash]
----
systemctl start evmserverd
----
This will do the task of restoring database automatically.
