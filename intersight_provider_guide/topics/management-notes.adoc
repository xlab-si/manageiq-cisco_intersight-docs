=== Reviewing {intersight-provider-title} EVM logs

Precondition for being able to review EVM logs, user needs to have appropriate permissions (.

Control -> Log` opens Last 1000 lines from server EVM in zone `default`. User with role `EvmGroup-super_administrator` can also download entire Policy Log File.

Moreover with the same user role and by navigating to `Settings -> Application Settings -> Digagnostics`, Diagnostic server EVM allows review of Workers, Collect Logs, ManageIQ Logs, Audit Log and Development Log.

=== Dump and restore Postgresql database

ManageIQ uses PostgreSQL Database. So while dealing with ManageIQ
database weâ€™ll need to follow PostgreSQL commands and procedure to take
a database dump as a backup and to restore it in another instance.

*Note: We will backup manageIQ ``vmdb_development'' database*

---

*This is list of steps followed to obtain a dump from a db then restore it*

==== Dump the Postgres DB:

[arabic]
. Stop the appliance(s):

    `systemctl stop evmserverd`

 - *This will stop the evmserverd.service from using database in background
but no need to stop them, for creating backup it does not affect
anything*

. Dump the database into file:

    `pg_dump -Fc vmdb_development > development.dump`

_If you get output similar to this_

[source,bash]
----
pg_dump: [archiver (db)] connection to database "vmdb_development" failed: connection to server on socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432" failed: FATAL: role "<your_username>" does not exist
----

_you can add `-U root` to every postgresql command (in postgresql
installation for ManageIQ you define root as the user of ManageIQ
databases)._

==== Import the Postgresql dump

[arabic]
. Take `development.dump` to machine where you want database to be
restored.
. Stop the backend processes

    `systemctl stop evmserverd`

. Drop existing database `vmdb_development`

    `dropdb vmdb_development`

. Create new database named `vmdb_development`

    `createdb vmdb_development`

. restore the database from dump file

    `pg_restore -d vmdb_development "path/to/development.dump"`

. Run `fix_auth.rb`

    `bundle exec tools/fix_auth.rb --v2 vmdb_development`

. Start evm service

    `systemctl start evmserverd`

_This will do the task of restoring database automatically_
