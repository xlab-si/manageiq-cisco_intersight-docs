== {intersight-provider-title} Release Notes

The goal of {intersight-provider-title} for {product-title} is to enable transparent management of Cisco-based
infrastructure through the {intersight} management layer. High level diagram of the provider (and most common use
 of the provider) is depicted in the diagram below:

{product-title} web service and {product-title} API are part of the {product-title} core system.
{intersight-provider-title} is integrated as the {product-title} provider using {intersight-provider-title} SDK library for the
interaction with the {intersight-provider-title} system.
For the communication it uses API keys with HTTP signature API authorization scheme provided by
{intersight-provider-title}.

The {product-title} uses {intersight-sdk-library} written in Ruby. The official Github repository of the library
resides here: https://github.com/xlab-si/intersight-sdk-ruby .

The {product-title} supports the following {intersight-provider} functionality:

* Inventory (Physical servers, Switches, Chassis)
* Power Operations
* Events
* Alarms
* Physical Server Configuration and Provisioning using Server Profiles
* Decommissioning and Recommissioning servers

=== Inventory
{intersight-provider} collects the inventory on all of the discoverable systems,
populating the {product-title_short}'s database. When a new provider is added,
the inventory operation is automatic. The subsequent inventory updates occur
either regularly or manually.

Depending on the capabilities of the systems under inventory collection process, the {intersight}
may distinguish between entities such as chassis, physical servers and switches.

These categories are mapped into {product-title} categories
as follows:

[options="header",alt="Physical infrastructure provider entity mapping"]
|===============================================================================
| {product-title_short} Convention. | {intersight} Convention.
| Physical Chassis                  | Chassis
| Physical Server                   | Blade, Server
| Physical Switch                   | Fabric Interconnect
|===============================================================================

=== Power Operations
Power operations change the status of the power supply of the system and can
also trigger a reboot of the target physical system. It is always possible
to request any power operation regardless of the system's current power
state. However, depending on the vendor's implementation, some operations
may not have any effect if the system is in a wrong state at the time when
it receives the request.

[options="header",alt="Power operation to power state mapping"]
|===============================================================================
| Power operation.                   | Expected power state after action.
| Power On                           | Powering On, On
| Power Off                          | Powering Off, Off
| Power Off Immediately              | Powering Off, Off
| Restart                            | Powering Off, Off, Powering On, On
| Restart Immediately                | Powering Off, Off, Powering On, On
|===============================================================================

=== Alarms and Events
{product-title} supports {intersight} events and alarms. On the {intersight} these are known as Requests and Alarms.
Requests are triggered by end-users and the {intersight} system itself, and Alarms triggered by {intersight} components
(e.g. "ethernet port down" warnings).

=== Server profiles

From {intersight}
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/Intersight/b_Intersight_Managed_Mode_Configuration_Guide.html[official documentation]:
"`In Intersight, a Server Profile enables resource management by
streamlining policy alignment, and server configuration. A server profile defines a server and its compute, storage,
 management, and network characteristics. When a server profile is deployed to a server, Intersight automatically
 configures the server and its connections to match the configuration specified in the server profile.`"

Collection of server profiles is obtained from the {intersight}. The system allows associating available server
 profiles to servers, and triggering deployment action of the server profile assigned to the server.

=== Decommissioning servers

From {intersight}
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/Intersight/b_Intersight_Managed_Mode_Configuration_Guide.html[official documentation]:
"`Decommission action decommissions the server and removes the server from the Cisco UCS configuration.
However, the server hardware physically remains in the Cisco UCS instance.`"

Recommission and decommission process of the servers ensures that the servers are not used in the quota of the user.
The provider collects a list of servers from a set of decommissioned servers that are available to the user in order
to expose them for a recommission process.
