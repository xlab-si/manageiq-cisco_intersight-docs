== Using {intersight-provider-full-title}

=== Updating {intersight-provider-title} credentials

This process follows similar flow as adding a provider. After creating a provider, you can navigate to the list of all
available physical providers and *Edit Selected Physical Infrastructure Providers* where the user can update
*Name*, *Zone*, and *Authentication credentials* details.

=== Examining {intersight-provider-title} Inventory

The physical infrastructure provider's dashboard provides an overview of the
inventory at a glance. To view it, first navigate to *Compute ->
Physical Infrastructure -> Providers* page from the main navigation on the
left, then click your {intersight-provider}.

NOTE: The {intersight-provider} does not support targeted refreshing of the
inventory. To make sure that the latest information is visible, please perform
*Configuration -> Refresh Relationships and Power States*. The statuses should
be up-to-date after a few seconds.
