== Using {intersight-provider-full-title}

=== Updating {intersight-provider-title} credentials

This process follows similar flow as adding a provider. After creating a provider, you can navigate to the list of all
available physical providers and *Edit Selected Physical Infrastructure Providers* where the user can update
*Name*, *Zone*, and *Authentication credentials* details.

=== Examining {intersight-provider-title} Inventory

The physical infrastructure provider's dashboard provides an overview of the
inventory at a glance. To view it, first navigate to *Compute ->
Physical Infrastructure -> Providers* page from the main navigation on the
left, then click your {intersight-provider}.

NOTE: The {intersight-provider} does not support targeted refreshing of the
inventory. To make sure that the latest information is visible, please perform
*Configuration -> Refresh Relationships and Power States*. The statuses should
be up-to-date after a few seconds.

To view a list of the resources discovered through the inventory, click on
the respective row of the *Relationships* table. For example, clicking on
the *Physical Servers* row will take you to the list of physical servers:

=== Managing the Physical System's Power Status

Physical servers may be remotely powered off, powered on or restarted through
{product-gui} using {intersight-provider}.

To power off a particular physical server, we first navigate to *Compute ->
Physical Infrastructure -> Servers* from the navigation on the left. On the
server list, we click on the server's name. This takes us to the server's
summary page, which provides the *Power* menu and displays the server's
current power state:

We can see that the server is currently powered on. To have it powered off, we
click on *Power -> Power Off*. We get a prompt to confirm the
selected action. After we click *Ok*, we will see the status showing the success
of sending the request:

The server should be powered off within a few seconds. To see the updated
status in the {product-gui}, use the *Configuration -> Refresh Relationships
and Power States*, wait a few seconds, then refresh the page in the browser.

Please refer to the <<ReleaseNotesIntersight>> section for further information
about the power management actions and statuses.
