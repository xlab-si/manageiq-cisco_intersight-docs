== Using {intersight-provider-full-title}

=== Updating {intersight-provider-title} credentials

This process follows similar flow as adding a provider. After creating a provider, you can navigate to the list of all
available physical providers and *Edit Selected Physical Infrastructure Providers* where the user can update
*Name*, *Zone*, and *Authentication credentials* details.

=== Examining {intersight-provider-title} Inventory

The physical infrastructure provider's dashboard provides an overview of the
inventory at a glance. To view it, first navigate to *Compute ->
Physical Infrastructure -> Providers* page from the main navigation on the
left, then click your {intersight-provider}.

NOTE: The {intersight-provider} does not support targeted refreshing of the
inventory. To make sure that the latest information is visible, please perform
*Configuration -> Refresh Relationships and Power States*. The statuses should
be up-to-date after a few seconds.

On the main dashboard of {intersight-provider} we can examine lists of:

* Chassis
* Servers
* Switches

*Racks* and *Storages* are currently not supported by the {intersight-provider}.

By clicking on *Servers* section user is presented with the list of all servers in the {intersight-provider.
By clicking on a specific server, view with detailed information of the server is shown. Set of different information
can be examined:

* Properties (Server name, Model, Product Name, Total memory, CPU total cores, Network Devices,...)
* Management Networks (list of networks associated with the server)
* Relationships (details on the host, link to the Physical Infrastructure Provider)
* Power Management (Power State and health)
* Firmwares
* Asset Details (Description, Location)
* Server Profiles (Assigned and Associated server profiles)

=== Managing the Physical System's Power Status

Physical servers may be remotely powered off, powered on or restarted through
{product-gui} using {intersight-provider}.

To power off a particular physical server, we first navigate to *Compute ->
Physical Infrastructure -> Servers* from the navigation on the left. On the
server list, we click on the server's name. This takes us to the server's
summary page, which provides the *Power* menu and displays the server's
current power state:

image::docs_intersight_using03_server_power_off.png[alt="Power menu and current state of the power to the server",600,align="center"]

We can see that the server is currently powered on. To have it powered off, we
click on *Power -> Power Off*. We get a prompt to confirm the
selected action. After we click *Ok*, we will see the status showing the success
of sending the request:

image::docs_intersight_using04_turn_off_confirmation.png[alt="Confirmation of successfully requesting to turn off the server",600,align="center"]

The server should be powered off within a few seconds. To see the updated
status in the {product-gui}, use the *Configuration -> Refresh Relationships
and Power States*, wait a few seconds, then refresh the page in the browser.

Please refer to the <<ReleaseNotesIntersight>> section for further information
about the power management actions and statuses.

=== Reviewing Alerts and Notifications from the {intersight} system

To view a list of the alerts and notifications obtained through the {intersight}'s API, first navigate to the
specific provider. By clicking on *Monitoring -> Timelines* it will take you to a view of *Timelines for Physical
Infrastructure Provider*. Under *Options* you should specify options as given in the figure below and  should provide
a time period you are interested in.

image::docs_intersight_using05_alarms_notifications.png[alt="Alarms and events",600,align="center"]

Currently, there are two groups of events supported by the {intersight} provider: *Updates* (notifications) and
*General Activity* (alarms). By clicking on a specific element in the timeline under section *Data* more details are
given for the specific element (alert, notification).

=== Decommission a server

User can decommission a server with an action from the *Lifecycle* menu on the provider. Selected server can be decommissioned as
depicted in the figure below.

image::docs_intersight_using06_decommission.png[alt="Decommission a server",600,align="center"]

=== Recommission a server

User can commission a server with an action from the *Lifecycle* menu on the provider. This way selected servers that
 have been already decommissioned can be commissioned and therefore made available to a user for further use.

image::docs_intersight_using07_recommission.png[alt="Recommission a server",600,align="center"]

NOTE: As soon as the server is recommissioned it takes some time for {intersight} to aggregates all the data from the
server (discovery process needs to finish).

=== Assigning a Server Profile

User can assign a server profile with an action from the *Intersight* menu in the server's details view in the provider.

image::docs_intersight_using08_01_sp_list.png[alt="List of servers",600,align="center"]

By clicking on *Intersight -> Assign Server Profile* user is presented with a list of available server profiles.
